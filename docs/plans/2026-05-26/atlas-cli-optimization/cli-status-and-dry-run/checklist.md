# Checklist: CLI 狀態查詢與預覽 (O1+O4)

- Date: 2026-05-26
- Feature: CLI 狀態查詢與預覽 (O1+O4)

## Usage Notes

- Add/remove items based on actual scope; keep only applicable items.
- Use `$test-case-strategy` for test level selection, oracle design, and drift-check planning.
- Property-based coverage required for business-logic changes unless `N/A` with reason.
- Test result values: `PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / NOT RUN / N/A`.

## Clarification & Approval Gate

- [ ] Clarification responses recorded (or `N/A` if none).
- [ ] Affected plans updated after clarification (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] Explicit approval obtained (date/ref: [to be filled]).

## Behavior-to-Test Checklist

- [ ] CL-01: [Observable behavior] — R?.? → [Test IDs] — Result: `[status]`
- [ ] CL-02: [Observable behavior] — R?.? → [Test IDs] — Result: `[status]`
- [ ] CL-03: [Observable behavior] — R?.? → [Test IDs] — Result: `[status]`

## Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Regression tests for bug-prone/high-risk behavior (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] Unit drift checks for non-trivial tasks (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] Property-based coverage for business logic (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] External services mocked/faked (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] Adversarial cases for abuse paths (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] Authorization, idempotency, concurrency risks evaluated (or `N/A` + reason).
- [ ] Assertions verify outcomes/side-effects, not just "returns 200".
- [ ] Fixtures reproducible (fixed seed/clock) (or `N/A` + reason).

## E2E / Integration Decisions

- [ ] [Flow/Risk]: [E2E / Integration replacement / Existing coverage / N/A] — Reason: [why]

## Execution Summary

- [ ] Unit: `[status]`
- [ ] Regression: `[status]`
- [ ] Property-based: `[status]`
- [ ] Integration: `[status]`
- [ ] E2E: `[status]`
- [ ] Mock scenarios: `[status]`
- [ ] Adversarial: `[status]`

## Completion Records

- [ ] [Flow/Group]: [completed / partial / blocked / deferred] — Remaining: [None / list]
